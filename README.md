To create a website that shows the current weather in Stockholm, we will use Python with the Flask web framework and the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data. We will also use the requests library to make API calls.

First, let's create the necessary files and their purposes:

1. app.py: The main entry point of the Flask application.
2. templates/index.html: The HTML template for the homepage.
3. requirements.txt: The list of Python dependencies for the project.
4. .env: A file to store sensitive information like API keys (not to be committed to version control).

Now, let's create the content of each file:

app.py
